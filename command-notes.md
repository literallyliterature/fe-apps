# Notes about different commands and situations

## Situations overview

1. No section
   1. we would want to be able to import
   2. otherwise, we would want to just create a new section
   3. we should have help, but filter it down to only show the relevant commands
2. We should always have a default page and context titled "Default"
   1. So, we should either have No section, OR have a selected section, page and context

   1. e.g. `d` would only be for todo items
